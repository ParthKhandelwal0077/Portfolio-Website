    <span><span>Happy Birthday Devu‚ô•Ô∏è¬†</span>
Sorry for being the last one to wish but my wishes would have already reached you through krishna.
Thank you for being best person I ever met. </span>

if you were wondering why i didn't text you or call you yesterday, I would just say that it was not easy for me to not call you on your birthday but I did it for me . The thing is complex Devu.  And I know you know that how much I still wanted to celebrate this day.
I wanted to see you that day on call but i think god knew that i wasn‚Äôt ready . If you think you will get to know....

    This website  is something that I wanted to gift you since last year , but kept procrastinating . I think I am still not much late . This is my interpretation and have features which I could think of are required right now . As you soar , more Pages like Covers and Media Blogs can be added as there wasn‚Äôt much content for them right now .¬†
This was created in rush and still need a lot of fixes but I hope ‚Äúthe efforts say the unsaid‚Äù.¬†

This is product of my own intensions and does‚Äôt bind you for anything Devu.

     <p>I hope you like the minimalism in this website , some photos in the gallery might not be that clear as they were sourced from your Instagram . 15 days from now , I will re-deploy the code with new feature which will enable you to upload pictures directly from your side , as well add more projects without much hassle . If you think ki koi shoot aisa h jisko projects mai daal sakte h toh let me know . 
      I confused about if I should add your height and all in about page , after all this can serve as a portfolio as well .  If you want ,we can add your mesurements too.
abhi devu if you want to send me suggestions for the design you want toh n just message me
or if you don‚Äôt wanna talk directly send me message through that contact form üòÇ and we can mark this our most formal period üòÇ.
and if you want you can share this in your bio ,but i would suggest to wait for some days and let me test with the security of this website first .
For now all the messages hat we will get from contact page, will be stored in the dataset . Mai wo bhi dekh lunga ki whenever someone sends us the message through contact us page , toh wo apke mail pe aajae.

    <span>While typing this all out I just wrote something, words just kept flowing out of my mind.</span>
    <span>
    ab ye raatien suni si h , 
n teri awaaz h , naah tere nakhro ki gooz si h,
pata h mujhe ki hum jaha h wahi hona h humko , sab likha hua h , aur usmai khona h humko ,
par mehnat se upr naah kuch tha naah kuch h, 
ab wahi h, iss khamoshi aur teri awaaz ke beech...

    <p>I am sorry again chotu,I feet very bad. Sometimes, I just miss you a lot but for the same unsaid reason which liberates me from a lot of post decision pain and regret, I just can't call you . 
    And ye sab cheez meri sript se kyu nhi hoti üò≠ this was supposed to reach out to yesterday , but issues came up with website jo ki apke sar ke upr se jaenge if I tried expaining. 
      A lot of things are unsaid here, I tried to keep things simple for us. But I think every thing is complex in it's vital nature and that's the best way it is.
    There a line that reminds me of you everytime 
    and it‚Äôs very significant :
¬†   <span>‚Äú‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§¶ teri roshni ka, halka sa ek saya hai‚Äù¬†</span>
Talk to you soon Devu. 
    <span>shine the brightest!</span>
    <span>Love you</span>
